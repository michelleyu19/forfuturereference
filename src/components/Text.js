        <p>in the pace of this world, we sometimes struggle to keep up especially in times (Covid, economy, BLM) understanding this is our natural instinct to keep up w the pace,
        we wanted to provide a tool to be able to capture a certain moment(takeaways, influences, thoughts )
        </p>
        <p>But how? In order to prevent us from hopping on the next quick thing,
        for future reference not only captures but is also a reminder of the current circumstances in order to strengthen us and one another.
        Following a time of reflection we want to give the opportunity to give encouragement and thanks to the people whoâ€™ve helped us along the way.
